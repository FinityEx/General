# General

*If you are here for recruitment evaluation, be sure to check the "Interview Kit" folder. None of that code is ground-breaking and never-before-seen, obviously, but it has been written by me to represent my knowledge regarding interview tasks. More code will follow.*

A repo of projects that I thought were going to be educational and fun to write.
While python is my main language, some C++ projects are going to appear here every once in a while.


More is regurarly added and any feedback is more than welcome!
