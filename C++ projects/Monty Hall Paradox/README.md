# Ever heard of Monty Hall Paradox?

Per wikipedia:
>The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

        Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

>Vos Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Under the standard assumptions, the switching strategy has a 2/3
 probability of winning the car, while the strategy that remains with the initial choice has only a 1/3
    probability.

The program runs a simulation of that game for both choices (with doors switched and without) as many times as user's input requires. 
Due to implemented random number generator, this program is an empirical proof that Vos Savant's advice to switch the doors was reasonable.
